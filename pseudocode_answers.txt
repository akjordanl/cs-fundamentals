Short Answer
1. To think through the logic of the program without having to think through the syntax of a particular language
2. The computer would not understand it.

Programming Assignment
1.
INPUT a number
INPUT another number
IF number > another number
  PRINT "Number is greater than another number"
ELSE IF number < another number
  PRINT "Another number is greater than number"
ELSE IF number = another number
  PRINT "Numbers are the same"
END IF

2.
FUNCTION oneToOneHundred
SET n = 1
WHILE n <= 100
  Print n
  n = n + 1
END WHILE

3.
INPUT Phonebook
INPUT Entry
FUNCTION searchPhonebookEntry
SET n = 0
FOR n <= Phonebook LENGTH
  IF Phonebook[n] != Entry THEN
    n = n+1
  ELSE IF Phonebook[n] = Entry THEN
    PRINT "Entry at n"
END FOR
  PRINT "Entry not found"

4.
function searchPhonebookEntry (Phonebook, Entry) {
  for (i = 0; i < Phonebook.length; i++) {
    if (Phonebook[i] === Entry) {
      return "Entry at i";
    }
  return "Entry not found";
  }
}

Note: in JavaScript I don't need to set the n=0 like my
pseudocode does because the for function already does
that for me when defining i
