Short answer
1. A stack draws from the top, meaning the last element added is drawn first.
A queue draws from the front, meaning the first element added is drawn first.

2. The similarity is both respect the order in which things are added.
Keeping elements organized relative to each other.

3. For UNDO and REDO I'd use a queue. One for each. In both cases the action we want
to remember first is the last action that happened. 

Programming question
1. Implement queue and dequeue in a class
class Queue {
  constructor(queue, element) {
    this.queue = queue;
    this.element = element;
  }
  
  // Methods
  enqueue() {
    return this.queue.push(element);
  }

  dequeue() {
    var temp = this.queue[0];
    this.queue.slice(0,1);
    return queue;
  }
}

var list = ["left","right","down"];

var enqueueTest = Queue(list, "up").enqueue();

var dequeueTest = Queue(list).dequeue();


console.log(list, enqueueTest, dequeueTest);
